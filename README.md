#  The Future of Cycling in Seattle: A Data Science Approach to Ridership Forecasting

This project is a part of the DATA 5100: Foundations of Data Science class in Fall 2022.
We will be focusing on extracting and comprehending cycling in Seattle as a part of the Bicycle Master Plan through a dataset that has been provided 
by the Seattle Department of Transportation, looking at total ridership for the Fremont Bridge, where observations are made every hour.
Through these trend analyses and observations, we will be able to arrive at actionable insights that will help the future of ridership in Seattle as we 
slowly but surely transition into a world that will eventually no longer depend on fossil fuels.


**This repository is currently split into 3 main branches:**

**Data Forecast:**
This branch includes our modeling phase of the project, where we are and will be utilizing the ARIMA for our initial modelling and further explore the DARTs library
which will allow us to forecast our data with a multitude of algorithms built into DARTs, we will be using multiple algorithms and comparing them to understand the 
best fit for our forecast.


**Data Exploration:**
Includes chunks of our code for the exploratory data analysis that was made to understand trends in the existing data. We utilized the universal Python language and
a mixture of libraries ranging from pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and many more. The code for graphs produced in our problem statement are mostly included in
this portion, along with other plots we were able to make.



**Data Upload:**
Our uploaded dataset from Seattle Department of Transportations live Fremont Bicycle Counter updated every month:
